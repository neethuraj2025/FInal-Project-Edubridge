    Overview
   </h2>
   <p1>
     A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound.This dataset provided for users whose they want to apply machine learning practices. This dataset collected from many more clients.

   Approach
  </h2>
  <p1>
The aim is to create a model that helps the users to apply machine learning approach to predict the satisfaction level. Here, the models used are
-> Logistic Regression<br>
-> Naive Bayes<br>
-> KNN<br>
-> Decision Tree<br>
-> Random Forest<br>
-> AdaBoost<br>
